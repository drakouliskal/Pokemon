Pokemon Coding Challenge for Avonic

# Execution instructions
Run main.py

# Description.
The assignment is to make a small console-based Pokemon Game. The goal of the game is to
allow a player to select a Pokemon from a range of choices and to initiate a fighting sequence with
another Pokemon. The fighting happens turn-based. Each Pokemon gets a turn to attack, until one
Pokemon’s health is depleted. The complexity of the game mechanics is secondary, our main
interest is what you have built under the hood.

# Software Requirements
1. Main menu so the user can initiate actions.
2. List all available Pokemon and be able to choose one as your main Pokemon. Create as
many Pokemon as you like, with a minimum of 5.
3. Being able to change your main Pokemon at any time.
4. Ability to initiate a fighting sequence. Before actually fighting, we pick an opposing
Pokemon.
5. An overview of what happens during the fight. Who is attacking who, what are the current
health stats, etc.
NOTE: Please push your code to a git repository and send us a link!

# Clean Code
There are a couple of aspects of your code that we find important. An important aspect of how we
evaluate your code is going to be its level of readability. Code is mostly read by your fellow
programmers and the ability to write concise yet understandable code is crucial in a team. That is
why we strongly encourage you to code using the SOLID principles. For a tutorial video click here.
These are also the principles we will be focusing on when we look at your code. For clarities’ sake,
here are some highlights:
● Readability
● Separation of Concerns (SoC)
● Naming conventions
● Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)
● Functions should only perform a single task
